### Goal

I have failed numerous times over the years to get Flask, gunicorn, and NGINX working together. I will give it another go. Below is the order
of how I think things should be done to keep things simple.

### TODO

- [] Get Python and Flask installed in a container
- [] Get gunicorn working in a container
- [] Get Flask working with gunicorn
- [] Finally, introduce NGINX

- [] Get this working on AWS with a default IP
- [] Get this working on AWS with a subdomain
